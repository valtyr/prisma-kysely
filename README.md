Do you like Prisma's migration flow, schema language and DX but not the
limitations of the Prisma Client? Do you want to harness the raw power of SQL
without losing the safety of the TypeScript type system?

**Enter `prisma-kysely`**!

### Setup

1. Install `prisma-kysely` using your package manager of choice:

   ```sh
   yarn add prisma-kysely
   ```

2. Replace (or augment) the default client generator in your `schema.prisma`
   file with the following:

   ```prisma
   generator kysely {
       provider = "prisma-kysely"

       // Optionally provide a destination directory for the generated file
       // and a filename of your choice
       output = "../src/db"
       fileName = "types.ts"
   }
   ```

3. Run `prisma migrate dev` or `prisma generate` and use your freshly generated
   types when instantiating Kysely!

### Motivation

Prisma's migration and schema definition workflow is undeniably great, and the
typesafety of the Prisma client is top notch, but there comes a time in every
Prisma user's life where the client becomes just a bit too limiting. Sometimes
we just need to write our own multi table joins and squeeze that extra drop of
performance out of our apps. The Prisma client provides us with just two
options: using their simplified query API, or sending raw strings of SQL
forfeiting all hopes of typesafety in one go.

This is where the magic of Kysely comes into play. Kysely gives us the toolbox
to write expressive SQL queries while retaining full typesafety and
autocompletion. The problem with Kysely though is that it's not super
opinionated when it comes to schema definition and migration. What many users
resort to is using something like Prisma to define the structure of their
databases, and `kysely-codegen` to introspect their databases post-migration.

This package, `prisma-kysely`, is meant as a more integrated and convenient way
to keep Kysely types in sync with Prisma schemas. After making the prerequisite
changes to your schema file, it's just as convenient and foolproof as using
Prisma's own client.

I've been using this combo for a few months now in tandem with Cloudflare's D1
for my private projects and Postgres at work and I couldn't be happier. I hope
that it'll be as useful to all of you 😎

| `[typename]TypeOverride` | Allows you to override the resulting TypeScript type for any Prisma type. Useful when targeting a different environment than Node (e.g. WinterCG compatible runtimes that use UInt8Arrays instead of Buffers for binary types etc.) Check out the [config validator](https://github.com/valtyr/prisma-kysely/blob/main/src/utils/validateConfig.ts) for a complete list of options. |

### Gotchas

#### Default values

By default (no pun intended) the Prisma Query Engine uses JS based
implementations for certain default values, namely: `uuid()` and `cuid()`. This
means that they don't end up getting defined as default values on the database
level, and end up being pretty useless for us.

Prisma does provide a nice solution to this though, in the form of
`dbgenerated()`. This allows us to use any valid default value expression that
our database supports:

```prisma
model PostgresUser {
   id    String @id @default(dbgenerated("gen_random_uuid()"))
}

model SQLiteUser {
   id    String @id @default(dbgenerated("uuid()"))
}
```

### Contributions

OMG you actually want to contribute? I'm so thankful! 🙇‍♂️

Here's everything you need to do (let me know if something's missing...)

1. Fork and pull the repository
2. Run `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to start `tsc` in watch mode.
3. Make changes to the source code
4. Test your changes by editing `prisma/schema.prisma`, running `yarn prisma
generate` and checking the output in `prisma/types.ts`.
5. Create a pull request! If your changes make sense, I'll try my best to review
   and merge them quickly.

I'm not 100% sure the [type
maps](https://github.com/valtyr/prisma-kysely/blob/main/src/helpers/generateFieldType.ts)
are correct for every dialect, so any and all contributions on that front would
be greatly appreciated. The same goes for any bug you come across or improvement
you can think of.

### Shoutouts

- I wouldn't have made this library if I hadn't used Robin Blomberg's amazing
  [Kysely Codegen](https://github.com/RobinBlomberg/kysely-codegen). For anyone
  that isn't using Prisma for migrations I wholeheartedly recommend his package.
- The implicit many-to-many table generation code is partly inspired by and
  partly stolen from
  [`prisma-dbml-generator`](https://github.com/notiz-dev/prisma-dbml-generator/blob/752f89cf40257a9698913294b38843ac742f8345/src/generator/many-to-many-tables.ts).
  Many-too-many thanks to them!
